50 scales. (not using genderversion)
3 hyper sex scales (ComsxFac, HypSxRat, SxPrFAC)
147 corrolation differences

Expect if random: ~ 7 of these to be different with p < 0.05
Actually: 52 differences with p < 0.05
		  (4 with p > 0.95, so probably result of randomness)

Looking specifically at hypersexuality.  All pornography scales that show a significant corrolation difference for men and women are more strongly corrolated for women (Pnhomo, Pnheter, Pnearex).  Other pornography scales showed no statistically significant corrolation difference.  Also, all the scales that were found to be usefull when modeling hypersexuality and showed statistically significant gender corrolation difference (ComsxFac, SxPrFAC, Pnheter, sxdeny, Exhibit) were more strongly corrolated for women than for men.
